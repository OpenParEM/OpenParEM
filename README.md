**Open** **Par**allel **E**lectro**m**agnetic – A free and open-source frequency-domain full-wave electromagnetic simulator for 3D S-parameters and fields plus 2D propagation constants, characteristic impedances, and fields.  OpenParEM is a free, open-source project licensed under GPLv3 or later.

OpenParEM consists of OpenParEM2D and OpenParEM3D to solve 2D and 3D electromagnetic problems given a mesh and setup text files.  A complete simulator requires assembling a tool set to complete the setup, and instructions are provided along with tutorials demonstrating a working tool set based on open-source tools.

**Open** **Par**allel **E**lectro**ma**gnetic **2D** – A free, open-source electromagnetic simulator for 2D waveguides and transmission lines.

OpenParEM2D is a full-wave electromagnetic simulator that solves waveguides and transmission lines with arbitrary cross sections and conductor counts for the propagation constants, losses (dielectric, conductor, and surface roughness), characteristic impedances, and fields of the dominant and higher-order modes.  The tool uses advanced finite elements (FEM) of arbitrarily high order, adaptive mesh refinement, and parallel processing using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). An extensive set of worked examples demonstrate a variety of setups and solution styles using rectangular waveuide, coax, microstrip, coupled microstrip, and stripline.  A detailed document on the theory, methodology, and accuracy of OpenParEM2D is provided along with a comprehensive user's manual.

**Open** **Par**allel **E**lectro**m**agnetic **3D** – A free and open-source frequency-domain full-wave 3D electromagnetic simulator for S-parameters and fields.

OpenParEM3D is a full-wave electromagnetic simulator that solves the for the frequency-dependent vector electric and magnetic fields of general 3D structures and post-processes the fields to produce scattering parameters (S-parameters) between 2D wave ports and radiation patterns, gain, directivity, and radiation efficiency for antennas. Supported boundary conditions include impedance with surface roughness, 1st-order radiation, perfect electric conductor, and perfect magnetic conductor. The tool uses advanced finite elements (FEM) of arbitrarily high order, adaptive mesh refinement, and parallel processing using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). An extensive set of worked examples demonstrate a variety of setups and solution styles.  A detailed document on the theory, methodology, and accuracy of OpenParEM3D is provided along with a comprehensive user's manual.
