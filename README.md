**Open** **Par**allel **E**lectro**m**agnetic â€“ A free and open-source frequency-domain full-wave electromagnetic simulator for 3D S-parameters and fields plus 2D propagation constants, characteristic impedances, and fields.

This repository is in the process of combining the separate OpenParEMCommon, OpenParEM2D, and OpenParEM3D repositories into one repository for simplicity plus fully scripted compilation along with pre-compiled binaries.
