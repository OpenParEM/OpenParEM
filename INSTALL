Installing OpenParEM using the package with pre-compiled binaries
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The pre-compiled binary allows OpenParEM to be run on x86 Linux platforms without
installing any additional packages. The installation process is to download and 
unpack the binary distribution, set the PATH environment variable, then run the 
test script to ensure successful operation.

Execution with the pre-compiled binary is verified for the following operating
systems:

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
Redhat RHEL 9.5 [the binary is compiled on RHEL 9.5]
Debian 12
Suse SLES 15-SP6
Amazon 2023 AMI

The binary fails to run on the following systems:
Suse SLES 12-SP5 - The GLIBC binary in the Suse system is too old.

Detailed instructions:

1. Download the installation package OpenParEM-version-bin.tar.gz from
   https://openparem.org.
2. Copy the installation package to an installation directory "install_dir".
3. cd to install_dir and unpack the installation directory using the commands:

   $ tar -xf OpenParEM-version-bin.tar.gz
   $ ln -s OpenParEM-version OpenParEM

   Setting the link enables new revisions to be installed without having to
   modifiy the PATH environment variable in the shell configuration file.

4. In directory $HOME, edit the configuration file for the shell used for
   command line processing.

   example:
      a. cd $HOME
      b. check which shell is being used
         $ echo $SHELL
         /bin/bash
      c. for bash, the configuration file is .bashrc
      d. edit .bashrc with any text editor

5. Add the following paths to the shell configuration file:

   install_dir/OpenParEM/bin
   install_dir/OpenParEM/scripts

   example using the bash shell for install_dir:
      export PATH=install_dir/OpenParEM/bin:$install_dir/OpenParEM/scripts:$PATH

   example when install_dir is the user's home directory:
      export PATH=$HOME/OpenParEM/bin:$HOME/OpenParEM/scripts:$PATH

6. Copy the FreeCAD and ParaView Python scripts to the default locations.

   $ cd install_dir/OpenParEM/scripts
   $ OpenParEM_build --without-all

7. Save the configuration file, exit the text editor, and close the terminal.
8. Open a new terminal to pick up the new settings.
9. Test the installation:

   $ cd install_dir/OpenParEM/scripts
   $ OpenParEM_test

   If the two tests pass, then the installation is complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing OpenParEM using the package with source code and compilation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenParEM can be compiled from source, which is the preferred method for using
OpenParEM if the necessary build tools are installed or can be installed on the
system.  To simplify the build process, a build script is provided that includes
all dependencies so that a single command builds and tests the compiled binary.

The installation process is to download and unpack the binary distribution,
install any missing compilation tools, run the compilation script, update the PATH
environment variable, then run the test script to ensure successful operation.

Compilation is verified for the following x86 Linux operating systems:

Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
Redhat RHEL 9.5 
Debian 12
Amazon 2023 AMI

Compililation fails for the following operating systems:

Suse SLES 15-SP6 - fails during compilation of the MFEM library with a
                   segmentation fault reported by mpicxx
Suse SLES 12-SP5 - fails during configuration of Petsc for fortran bindings


--------------------------
Required Compilation Tools
--------------------------

The compilation tools make, g++, gfortran, and perl must be installed on the 
system to complete the installation.  The "which" command can be used to determine
if a tool is installed.  For example, if the command

   $ which make

returns a path, then make is installed.  If nothing is returned, then it is not
installed.

Missing tools can be installed using the system's package manager.  For Linux 
versions using the Debian package manager APT (used on Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint,
and others), the commands are

   $ sudo apt update
   $ sudo apt-get install make
   $ sudo apt-get install g++
   $ sudo apt-get install gfortran
   $ sudo apt-get install perl

For Redhat RHEL and Amazon AMI, the yum package manager is used with the commands:

   $ sudo yum update
   $ sudo yum install make
   $ sudo yum install g++
   $ sudo yum install gfortran
   $ sudo yum install perl

For Suse SLES, the zypper package manager is used with the commands:

   $ sudo zypper update
   $ sudo zypper install make
   $ sudo zypper install gcc-c++
   $ sudo zypper install gcc-fortran
   $ sudo zypper install perl

Note that installing packages requires system-level installation priviledges.

----------------------------
Compilation and Installation 
---------------------------

1. Download the installation package OpenParEM-version.tar.gz from
   https://openparem.org.
2. Copy the installation package to a src directory "src_dir"
3. cd to src_dir and unpack the src tree using the commands:

   $ tar -xf OpenParEM-version.tar.gz
   $ ln -s OpenParEM-version OpenParEM

   Setting the link enables new revisions to be installed without having to
   modifiy the PATH environment variable in the shell configuration file.

4. cd to OpenParEM/scripts.
5. Compile and install in the src tree by running the script "OpenParEM_build".

   example:
      $ ./OpenParEM_build --jobs=4 --with-all

      The installation directory install_dir=src_dir/OpenParEM and the
      compilers use 4 processors for faster compilation. All libraries are
      compiled for maximum compatibility, and testing of OpenParEM primarily uses
      the --with-all option.  Generally, set the number of jobs equal to the
      number of high-performance cores on the computer.

   example:
      $ ./OpenParEM_build --jobs=4 

      cmake, flex, bison, and Open MPI are not compiled and installed if they are
      found on the system.  For Open MPI, the development package must be
      installed in addition to the executable package.

   Compilation does not require administrator priviledges unless the --prefix
   option below is specified with a location in an area where the user does not
   have write priviledges.

   Some compiling issues are reported with a message "See 'config.log' for
   more details".  The config.log file is located in the directory where
   the error occured, not the directory from which the OpenParEM_build is run.
   To find the config.log file, execute

      $ find .. -name "config.log" -print

6. OpenParEM can be in installed in a different location given as "install_dir"
   by providing the location to the build script with the --prefix option.

   example installing in the directory $HOME/local:
      $ ./OpenParEM_build --jobs=4 --prefix=$HOME/local --with-all

      In this case, install_dir=$HOME/local.  The directory "local" must
      exist before running the script.

7. When compilation completes, OpenParEM2D and OpenParEM3D are tested. If
   the two tests pass, then the basic installation is complete and just the
   PATH environment variable needs to be set.

8. In directory $HOME, edit the configuration file for the shell used for
   command line processing.

   example:
      a. cd $HOME
      b. check which shell is being used
         $ echo $SHELL
           /bin/bash
      c. for bash, the configuration file is .bashrc
      d. edit .bashrc with any text editor

9. Add the following paths to the shell configuration file:

   install_dir/bin
   src_dir/OpenParEM/scripts

   example using the bash shell for an in-place installation with src_dir=$HOME
      export PATH=$HOME/OpenParEM/bin:$HOME/OpenParEM/scripts:$PATH

   example when src_dir=$HOME and install_dir=$HOME/local 
      export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$HOME/OpenParEM/scripts:$PATH

10. Save the configuration file, exit the text editor, and close the terminal.
11. Open a new terminal to pick up the new settings.
13. Test the installation with these commands:

   $ cd src_dir/OpenParEM/scripts
   $ OpenParEM_test

   If the two tests pass, then the installation is complete.
