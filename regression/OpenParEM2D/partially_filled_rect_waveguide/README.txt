These examples are various runs of the same problem with different setups.
The problem is derived from Fig. 4-7 on page 161 from:
  Roger F. Harrington, "Time-Harmonic Electromagnetic Fields", McGraw-Hill, 1961.
The transcendental equations for the propagation constant are solved in waveguide.c in the src directory.
