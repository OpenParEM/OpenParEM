to setup a new autotools directory:
aclocal

to get a very rough starting configure.ac file:
autoscan
mv configure.scan configure.ac

to find libraries:
find . -name "lib*.a" -print

to list executables in library:
nm lib*.a | grep T

to find an executable in a group of libraries:
nm -o *.a | grep "T executablename"

to generate configure shell script:
autoconf

to run the script:
./configure

to review errors:
vi config.log

to build the make file:
automake --add-missing

to build:
make


general sequence:
aclocal
autoconf
automake --add-missing
./configure
make
